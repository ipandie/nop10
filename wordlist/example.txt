You can have the results you want, or you van have excuses. You can't have both

will shine in the future, i guess

Sometimes the smallest step in the right direction end up being the biggest step of your life for your success

Don't be shy to admit that we are not perfect humans. Because it is this imperfection that makes fragile thread embroidery together and binds between us

In a growth mindset, challenges are exciting rather than threatening

If opportunity does not come to you, then create it

When you want to give up, look at back and then see how far you have climbed to reach your goal

If the plan doesn't work, change the plan but never the goal

"Patience is a virtue, and I'm learning patience. It's a tough lesson." - Elon Musk

There is no elevator to success. You have to take the stairs

You need to stop trying to change who you are and just make who you are better for your future

If we never try, we will never know

If you are born in a poverty, it's not your fault. But if you die in a poverty, it's being an absolute mistake you have made

Getting up in the morning is a sign that you can achieve the life's goal better than yesterday
